## Prerequisites
1. Place your env variables in a file called .env. For convenience, there is a sample file (filename needs to be changed from env to .env) formatted for you. Your code file and test file will need these variables.
2. Edit the file contents of 'new_example_file.tf'.

## Usage
`go run main.go`

## Testing
`go test`
